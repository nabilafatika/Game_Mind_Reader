# Game_Mind_Reader
The game is a simple implementation of a mind reading game where the player competes against the computer (bot) to see who can reach a score of 5 first.

<ul> Objective : The objective of the game is to guess whether the next number chosen by the player and the bot will be 0 or 1.</ul>
<ul> Interface : The game interface consists of two buttons labeled '0' and '1' for the player to make their choice. There is also a progress bar for both the player and the bot, indicating their current scores.</ul>

# Here's how the game works:
<p> Gameplay :
<ul>• The player clicks either the '0' or '1' button to make their choice. </ul>
<ul>• The computer (bot) randomly chooses either 0 or 1. </ul>
<ul>• If the player's choice matches the bot's choice, the bot's score increases by 1. </ul>
<ul>• If the player's choice does not match the bot's choice, the player's score increases by 1. </ul>
<ul>• The game continues until either the player or the bot reaches a score of 5. </ul>    
</p>

<p> Winning Condition :
<ul>• If the player reaches a score of 5 first, they win, and a winning message appears. </ul>
<ul>• If the bot reaches a score of 5 first, the player loses, and a losing message appears. </ul>
<ul>• If both the player and the bot reach a score of 5 at the same time, the game ends in a draw, and a draw message appears.</ul>
</p> 

<p> Reset Button : <p>
<p> There is also a 'Reset' button available to restart the game after it has ended.</p>

This project is a component of my coursework for the Artificial Intelligence course during my college years. The game offers an engaging and interactive platform for testing predictive algorithms and human-computer interaction dynamics. Players compete against a computer opponent, leveraging both strategy and chance to reach the target score first. This project exemplifies the practical application of AI principles in game development, providing an insightful exploration of machine learning techniques and their real-world implementations.
